# Sign-Language-Recognition

Samwaad is a powerful communication platform designed to bridge language gaps, enabling effective and seamless interaction for those with speech impairments. The project utilizes advanced deep learning techniques,  and computer vision to recognize and translate sign language into text or speech, facilitating better communication in various environments.

Features
Sign Language Recognition: Converts hand gestures into readable text using a deep learning model, achieving high accuracy.
Real-Time Processing: Efficient real-time gesture recognition powered by neural networks like CNN and advanced frameworks.

Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
ðŸŽ® How It Works:
Key Pressed	Action
Aâ€“Z	Simulates a recognized gesture
SPACE	Confirms current word
ENTER	Speaks the full sentence
R	Resets everything
ESC	Exits the loop
